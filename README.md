# Simple_Linear_Regression
This project implements Simple Linear Regression on the Tips dataset, aiming to model the relationship between the total bill and the tip amount in a restaurant setting. Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used to understand the relationship between two continuous variables. By applying this technique to the Tips dataset, we gain insights into how the tip amount varies with the total bill.

Some Key Steps of this project are:
Understanding the Dataset:
We begin by loading the Tips dataset, which contains information about total bills and tip amounts in a restaurant.
We ensure that the dataset is clean and free from any missing values or outliers.
Data Visualization:
Visualizations, such as scatter plots, are created to illustrate the relationship between the total bill and the tip amount.
These visualizations help in identifying any patterns or trends present in the data.
Model Building:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the Simple Linear Regression model.
Utilizing the scikit-learn library, we build a Simple Linear Regression model that predicts the total bill amount based on the tip.
Model Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
By comparing the predicted tip values with the actual tip values, we assess the accuracy of the model.
Results:
The Simple Linear Regression model demonstrates a reasonably good fit to the data, as evidenced by the low Mean Squared Error and high R-squared values.
The regression line plotted over the test data visually illustrates how well the model captures the relationship between the total bill and tip amount.
